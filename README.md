CampusLink: Smart LoRa Communication Network

CampusLink is a lightweight, offline communication system built using ESP32 and LoRa (SX1278) modules. It enables long-range text messaging between multiple campus nodes without the need for internet or GSM networks. Messages are sent through a Wi-Fi web interface and displayed on OLED screens, while a dedicated logging node stores all message logs.
